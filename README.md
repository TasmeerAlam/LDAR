# LDAR
## Link Dependent Adaptive Radio (LDAR) TDMA Prototype for iNET


## Project Overview

This repository contains the MATLAB code and documentation for the Link Dependent Adaptive Radio (LDAR) prototype, developed to meet the iNET standard for aeronautical telemetry. The LDAR system dynamically adapts its modulation and coding scheme in response to real-time changes in channel conditions, optimizing communication between a Ground Station and a Test Article.


## Features

Dynamic Modulation and Coding: Adjusts the modulation scheme and coding rate based on live channel analysis to maximize throughput and maintain link quality.

TDMA Signaling Structure: Implements a simplified Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) structure for effective uplink and downlink communication as required by iNET standards.

Adaptive Communication Protocol: Features a robust protocol for the transmission of Command and Data Messages, ensuring continuous adaptation of the radio system to the channel conditions.

Real-time Performance Analysis: Continuously evaluates channel conditions (SNR, delay spread) and adjusts the transmission settings to optimize data rate and error performance.
